# USDA AMS - Data and Metrics

The Data and Metrics initiative is focused on fostering greater data efficacy and literacy across local and regional food systems by engaging project stakeholders in completing a gap analysis of existing local and regional food system data, fostering peer mentorship, and providing technical assistance. 
In part to accomplish these goals, teams of researchers and community partners reviewed and compiled available data using an equity lens into a single data warehouse to facilitate analysis and visualization. The initiative first began by reviewing the mission statements from national local and regional food system network leaders. Mission statements were organized into six categories â€“ labor, farm development/local food sales, business development/food infrastructure, community wealth/well-being, nutrition security/food access, and policy. For each of the categories, except for policy, the teams created document briefs identifying key related data indicators available nationwide at the county level. Creators of data warehouses, data explorers, and data dashboards encounter several challenges when it comes to the issue of equity. Reliance on existing data limited the ability to disaggregate data by dimensions of race, ethnicity, and citizenship status. As a result, we encourage the use of practices that invite community members to help contextualize data, share their personal stories, and amplify community solutions. The data warehouse is open-source and additional contributions are welcome, see below.  


## Goals of the Project

  * Support the utilization of data in program evaluation and decision making. 
  
  * Improve access to data from an array of sources including government, NGOs, network partners, and researchers. 


## Contributions

We will accept suggestions of data to add to our data repository and website. Please follow instructions, as described on our website (link), to submit a request to add data. 

This is not an active code base and we are not accepting contributions to the code. The code is made available for you to use in your own work if it is helpful.
