This is our code from the AMS Local Food Economics Data Visualization Challenge

Our data files are too large for Github so email: ljsobo@iastate.edu for the zip file.

The Deliverables folder contains our final outputs and the code folder contains our code. 

Unfortunately, the .shp files are too large for Github and I should also mention that running the segments of code
that recover the distance of a synthetic family from its nearest waterway takes close to 24 hours because of the
sheer number of data points that describe the geometries of the waterways.
